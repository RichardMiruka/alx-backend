# How To Do Pagination In Python

Pagination is a technique used in computing and web development to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable segments called pages.

This is particularly common in the context of displaying data in user interfaces, such as web pages, where showing all data at once might be impractical or overwhelming.

## Implement Pagination in Web Application

Python script (tkiner_pagination.py) utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple pagination application with themed styling. The app displays a Treeview widget and allows navigation between pages using “Previous” and “Next” buttons. It includes a dynamic number of pagination buttons, and each button corresponds to a page of items. The script defines a PaginationApp class, showcasing the implementation of page navigation and updating the Treeview accordingly. The example usage at the end demonstrates creating an instance of the app with a list of numbers and a specified page size.
